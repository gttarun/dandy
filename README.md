# Dandy

** NOTE: Make sure *python3* and *pip* is installed.**

## Setup

### AngularJS Frontend:

In the **/frontend** folder:

    `python -m http.server &`

This will serve this folder up in a local web server, which can be accessed from *localhost:8000*

### Python/Flask Backend:

In the **/backend** folder:

1. Start a virtual envirtonment

    `python3 -m venv ./venv`

2. Activate the environment 

    `source ./venv/bin/activate`

3. Install al dependencies

    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

4. Export flask app

    `export FLASK_APP=app.py`

5. Initialize and migrate database

    `flask db init
    flask db migrate
    flask db upgrade`

6. Run flask app

    `flask run`

The backend should now be running at *localhost:5000*

### Populate database:

In the web browser, go to:

    `localhost:5000/sync`

This will populate the database will all the dog breeds, so that autocomplete will work as the user fills out the surveyâ€” the response should be **SUCCESS**

**Warning: only populate the database ONCE**

## Try it out

### Add any and all doggos:
Navigate to 

    `localhost:8000/`

This should direct you to the first page of the dandy survey page, where it will ask you of the *dog name*

Follow and use the app as directed :) Go ahead and add as many dogs as you'd like.

### (Finally) Check database to verify:

Navigate to 

    `localhost:5000/dogs`

This will show you all the dogs in the database that were added through the Dandy survey.
